## Chapter 1: Clue and Dee

"When was the last time we've seen one of these?" asked Clue, pointing his sword at the ground.

"At least a week ago," replied Dee, "They're nasty things, aren't they?"

"I wouldn't say they're nasty, they're just... *different*." Clue lowered himself to take a better look.

Dee took her eyes away from the dead monster and found a nearby tree to lean on. The monster attacks near town were getting more frequent, something had to be done, but nobody knew where these monsters came from. Clue had some ideas, but Dee knew most of them were just wild guesses.

Clue, pensive, suddenly stood up. "Dee, we may have to ask the Oracle for help."

"What?" shouted Dee, "No! We can't bother them with this, we'll have to figure this out on our own."

"How to you expect us to do this when whomever goes looking for these things ends up dead?"

"We'll just have to do better than they did."

Clue, frustrated, knew he couldn't afford an argument. Monsters would sneak into the stables at night to attack the animals, without their work horses the harvest was far behind schedule. They had no choice, they would either stop the monsters or lose their livelihood.

"Fine... but we need to be smart about this. We can't just head to the wastes without any sort of idea of what we're getting in to, and nobody in town has any idea what is happening out there."

"Don't overthink these things, we've dealt with worse than these monsters before." Dee stopped leaning on the tree. "I know how to kill these things, they aren't that tough."

"Dee, I won't overthink things. Let's just rest for the night before making any more decisions, it's getting late." The sun agreed with Clue, Dee couldn't deny.

"Alright, that's fair."

Clue took Dee's hand and they both began their walk home. It wasn't easy, their lives, and the recent complications only made things worse for the townsfolk. They both knew that the monster problem needed fixing as soon as possible.

"Clue, I'm glad you're here." said Dee, "Sara would be glad you're helping us."

Clue just looked at his feet, too embarrassed to say a thing.

-----------------------

The town was typical, from a mortal point of view. Nothing lasts forever, the mortals understood that better than Uther ever could, but they built their houses to last generations. It was fun to watch them, living their lives, herding their animals, playing their games. He hadn't much to do himself, things were quiet on his end.

The monster attacks had been interesting, but not significant enough for him to intervene. Every time a mortal met their death at the hand of a monster Uther felt pity. He really did want to help, but they hadn't asked for it. He needed mortal permission to enter their realm, and few remembered how to even ask.

Uther sat up, his shift was almost over.
